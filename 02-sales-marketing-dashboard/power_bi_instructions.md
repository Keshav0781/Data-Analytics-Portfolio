# Power BI Dashboard Instructions

This document explains how to use the synthetic sales & marketing dataset with Power BI to build an interactive dashboard.

## Steps
1. Open Power BI Desktop.
2. Connect to the `sales.db` SQLite database (generated by `01_create_sqlite_db.py`).
3. Load the following tables:
   - `sales`
   - `products`
   - `customers`
4. Build relationships:
   - `sales.product_id` → `products.product_id`
   - `sales.customer_id` → `customers.customer_id`

## Recommended Visuals
- **KPI Cards:** Total Revenue, Total Units Sold, Average Order Value.
- **Line Chart:** Monthly revenue trend.
- **Bar Chart:** Revenue by product category.
- **Stacked Bar Chart:** Revenue by region and product category.
- **Pie Chart:** Customer distribution by segment.
- **Heatmap / Matrix:** Revenue by month vs. region.

## Example DAX Measures
- `Total Revenue = SUM(sales[revenue])`
- `Total Units = SUM(sales[quantity])`
- `Average Order Value = DIVIDE([Total Revenue], [Total Units], 0)`
